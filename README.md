# Wireless Network Modeling Workshop
This hands-on workshop features guided exercises that teach the end-to-end workflow for modeling 5G and WLAN networks in MATLAB®. 
You'll also explore how to model and simulate wireless coexistence scenarios, using WLAN and Bluetooth as a practical example.
Through these exercises, you'll write and run your code in MATLAB and discover how to model and simulate cellular and connectivity networks with minimal coding. 
You'll also learn how to visualize and analyze key performance metrics, enabling faster insights into network behavior and design trade-offs.

## Who Should Take the Workshop:
This workshop is intended for wireless system architects and engineers, MAC and PHY engineers, and wireless researchers.

## What Attendees Will Learn:
* MATLAB-based Workflow for 5G, WLAN, and Bluetooth Network Modeling
* Simulate standards-based networks and measure key network KPIs
* Visualize network behavior in real time and log performance for post-processing and analysis
* Model typical and custom network scenarios to evaluate overall performance.

## Setup
This repo contains the files required to run the hands-on Wreless network modeling workshop in MATLAB®. The "Exercise" files require code additions to  
run.  The "Solution Scripts" files have the required code additions and run to completion.

The files enable the following exercises:
1. Exercise 1 - Operate the simulation engine, configure 5G nodes, create a simple network, and see statistics
2. Exercise 2 - Operate the simulation engine, configure WLAN nodes, create a simple network, and see statistics

To Run:
1. To conduct the workshop, use the "Exercise" files
2. To simply run the completed exercises, run the following files in MATLAB:

* EXPL1\_NR\_Simplest\_Network.mlx
* EXPL2\_WLAN\_Simplest\_Network.mlx
